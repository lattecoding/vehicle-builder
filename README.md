# Vehicle Builder

## User Story

Wanted to make an applicatiion that walks through the steps taking user prompts on making a vehicle. It wouldn't matter if it was a Car, Truck, or Motorbike. The correct information would be passed about the vehicle and properly presented back to the user. This is all doing with Node.js through the command line.
